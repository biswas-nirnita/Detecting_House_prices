<h1>About</h1>
I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by SHAPEAI. This project uses boston housing datasets which basically contains information about different houses in Boston. We have accessed this data from the scikit-learn library. To predict the value of prices of the house using the given features a linear regression model has been used.
